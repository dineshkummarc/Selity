/**
 * Events Manager interface.
 *
 * The Events Manager interface is the central point of i-MSCP's event listener
 * system. The listeners are registered on the manager, and events are dispatched through
 * the manager.
 *
 * A listener is an object or a callback function that listen on a particular event. The events are defined in many
 * places in the core code or components. When a event is dispatched, the listener methods of all the listeners that
 * listens this event are executed.

Introduction
------------

Since i-MSCP Beta 1, we are using the Transifex service to translate our translation
files. In the past, we used several shell scripts for updating translation files but
it was tedious.

Before the process was as follows:

1.	Updating the iMSCP.pot (portable object template) file with the makemsgs script
2.	Updating all the *.po files (portable object files) with the updateToPOT script
3.	Checking all the *.po files (in strict mode) with the checkPo script

The remaining problem with the process described below is that the developer had to
fix some issues manually in the *.po files after the update due to the fuzzy strings
usage that ommit some parameters.

With Transifex, the process is more simple except the first time because you have to
install a specific client on your system to communicate with Transifex service.


System Requirements
-------------------
- gettext
- Transifex client

In order, to be able to update translation files, you must have the gettext tool and
the Transifex client installed on your system.

Installation process (Debian)

As root:

1.	Installing gettext

	# aptitude install gettext

2.	Installing Transifex client

	# aptitude install python-setuptools
	# easy_install -- upgrade transifex-client

As normal user:

3. Creating the Transifex configuration file

	$ touch ~/.transifexrc

And putting the following content in it:

[main]
[https://www.transifex.net]
hostname = https://www.transifex.net
password = PASSWORD
token =
username = USERNAME

Of course, you have to change the PASSWORD and USERNAME with your own Transifex login
data.


Updating translation files
--------------------------

As normal user:

1.	Use the shell script "makemsgs" to get all strings from GUI php files within
	the i18n/po/iMSCP.pot file

	$ cd {YOUR_WORKING_COPY}/i18n/tools
	$ sh ./makemsgs

2.	Pushing the new iMSCP.pot on Transifex

	$ cd {YOUR_WORKING_COPY}/i18n
	$ tx push -s

The *.po files will be automatically updated by Transifex and no more checking is
needed from your side.

3. Getting updated *.po files from Transifex

	$ cd {YOUR_WORKING_COPY}/i18n
	$ tx pull -af


Compiling translation files
---------------------------

As normal user

1.	Use the shell script "compilePo" to compile all *.po files

	$ cd {YOUR_WORKING_COPY}/i18n/tools
	$ sh ./compilePo

After that, you have just to commit the changes on our svn repository (trunk).

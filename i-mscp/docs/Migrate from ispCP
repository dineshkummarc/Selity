Migration from ispCP to i-MSCP

This intends to be a guide for those interested into migrate your control panel from
ispcp to imscp. Luckily there's a standard migration path ready for us.

Currently you can go from ispCP 1.0.7 to i-MSCP 1.0.3.0 or newer.

IMPORTANT: Test it before with a clone of your system, there could be problems and
it's important to find them on the test phase

1.  Download the current version of i-mscp from http://i-mscp.net/download
2.  Untar the downloaded file

    # tar -xzf i-mscp-1.0.3.0.tar.gz

3.  Start the installation of the system (as you would for a new install), but
    IMPORTANT, when you see the i-mscp setup screen. SAY NO, because you've to
    continue using the console instead of this installer.

    # perl imscp-autoinstall

4.  Until you see the i-mscp setup screen. SAY NO, because you've to continue using
    the console. Copy the generated files into their destination, after this point
    there's NO POSSIBLE ROLLBACK

    # cp -Rv /tmp/imscp/* /

5.  It's interesting to have the debug enabled to inspect possible problems, you have
    to change in /etc/imspc/imscp.conf

    DEBUG = 1

6.  Now you have to use the migration script wich will be already in place.

    # cd /var/www/imscp/engine/setup/
    # perl imscp-migrate-from-ispcp

7.  After the run of this script you'll have to run the regular install

    # perl /var/www/imscp/engine/setup/imscp-setup

If all the steps are fine, you should be able to enter in the control panel
Some considerations

The logs for either a failed or succesful setup will be at /var/log/imscp/imscp-setup.log

    # less /var/log/imscp/imscp-setup.log

The database user MUST have full privileges (or else it won't be able to create and
populate the imscp table). You have two options, either using the root database user
or having a database user with full rights:

    # mysql -u root -p
    # GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_database_user'@'localhost'
